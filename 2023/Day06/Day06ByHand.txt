This is a super short problem that can actually be done by hand! The only long part, is essentially a game of higher or lower to find the lowest time required. After that it's pretty basic math. For fun I did it by hand!

time: 41
distance: 214
minTime: 7
maxTime: 34
numCombos: 34 - 7 + 1 = 28

time: 96
distance: 1789
minTime: 26
maxTime: 70
numCombos: 70 - 26 + 1 = 45

time: 88
distance: 1127
minTime: 16
maxTime: 72
numCombos: 72 - 16 + 1 = 57

time: 94
distance: 1055
minTime: 14
maxTime: 80
numCombos: 80 - 14 + 1 = 67

answer = 28 * 45 * 57 * 67 = 4811940
