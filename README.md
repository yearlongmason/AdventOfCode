# AdventOfCode
This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code programming puzzles from each year. Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that runs from December 1st to December 25th, where each day a new puzzle is released. The puzzles are designed to be solved with any programming language, and they progressively increase in difficulty throughout the month.

# What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is a series of small Christmas themed programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. Participants solve puzzles, earn stars, and can compete on global or private leaderboards. It's a fun way to improve problem-solving skills and learn more about programming!

# Structure
Each year has it's own folder of solutions.
Each day's solution is contained in its own folder. The folder for each day typically includes:
- The puzzle input provided by Advent of Code for that day (txt file).
- My solution to the day's puzzle, usually implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (ipynb file).
